The requirement is:
* Show a popup window with the option to choose a user, and two fields type text,
    these 3 fields must be mandatory if the product chosen is in the list of model "comision.config_line",
    in case the product Do not be in this list, do not show the pop-up window.

* Each point of sale can have different "comision.config_line", so the "pos.config" has a variable "comision_id"

* The pop-up window should only show the users that have the boolean "supervisor_pos"

* When confirming the sale the fields filled in (user and 2 text fields) must appear in the "pos.order.line"
